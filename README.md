# webscrape-goodreads
Currently webscrapes Goodreads for current giveaways. We are planning on implementing more, particularily webscraping various sites for price comparision of books. 


TO DO:
1. Add backend to be used as a shopping cart
2. Once the user is ready to "check out" they will get an email of their order with links to where to buy (downloadable excel sheet) 
3. once the user checks out, we can send an email linking 
4. Add sorting (eg, sort books by author, genre, ratings)
